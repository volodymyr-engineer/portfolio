I developed the first automated tests that covered key business processes while formalizing testing standards. I also wrote documentation that helped new team members quickly get up to speed with the approaches and tools. Thanks to this, we started detecting defects early and reduced the risk of regressions by nearly a third. In parallel, I closely collaborated with developers, DevOps engineers, and product managers to make quality assurance an integral part of the release lifecycle.",

        "goal": "Provide reliable, decentralized communication between military, governmental and scientific institutions — even in the event of a nuclear strike.",
        "second-part": "The experiment with ARPANET was so successful that many organizations wanted to join it for everyday data transmission purposes. In 1975, ARPANET transitioned from an experimental network to an operational one. The responsibility for managing the network was taken over by the Defence Communication Agency (DCA), which is now known as the Defence Information Systems Agency (DISA). However, the development of ARPANET did not stop there.",
        "world-wide-web": "The next significant stage in development was the emergence of the World Wide Web, based on the HTTP data transfer protocol and a special format for presenting data — HTML. Until that point, the Internet had mostly been used by specialists for exchanging technical documentation and messages, primarily via email.",
        "web-2": "And the final stage in development can be considered the so-called Web 2.0 — characterized by the rapid advancement of mobile technologies. This led to a dramatic increase in data volumes, including photos and videos, as well as instant sharing of such content. The constant use of the Internet for information search marked a new era of the web. The global network became closely intertwined with satellite communications and various location-determining systems. Moreover, the low power consumption of smartphones, laptops, and other mobile devices further reduced barriers to using the Internet anytime and anywhere."

        "explanation": "To connect to the Internet, you first need to link your computer or laptop to a router or modem — this connection is the foundation for accessing the network. When you open a browser and type in an address like “www.google.com,” your system sends a request to your Internet Service Provider (ISP), which is, in turn, connected to servers that store and process data.The browser processes the entered address and converts it into a numerical format — this is a kind of language that the system uses to recognize the unique address of a resource. The browser then sends an HTTP request to the corresponding server, which responds by sending a copy of the website in the form of small data packets.When all these packets arrive on your computer, the browser assembles them like a puzzle, and you then see the full version of the website on your screen.",        "image-alt": "This diagram shows the typical way that most users send data today.
